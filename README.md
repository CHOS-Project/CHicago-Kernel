# Build instructions

You need the build environment files that are included with the main repository (<https://github.com/CHOSTeam/CHicago>).
The same instructions from the main repository are valid here, but if you want to only build the kernel, you need first to select into the kernel project (type 's kernel' in the build environment prompt).
If you clone this repository into a folder with any other name than 'kernel', you need to change the command into 's \[folder name\]'.
