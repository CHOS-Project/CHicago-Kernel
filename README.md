# CHicago Kernel

This is the portable kernel that CHicago uses. Currently, the kernel supports x86, amd64, and arm64.

# Building

Make sure that the toolchain is already built (run make on the toolchain/kernel folder if you want just the kernel toolchain, or under the toolchain folder for both kernel and boot toolchains), and run make.
View the makefile for the available flags/modifiers (TODO: Also document it here).
